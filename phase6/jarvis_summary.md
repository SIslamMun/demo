# Phase 5 Jarvis Workflow Execution Summary

## Overview
Successfully executed Phase 5 computational workflow using Jarvis pipeline management system.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Pipeline Initialization
- Created and loaded `phase5_pipeline`
- Pipeline status: Successfully initialized

### 2. Node Allocation Configuration
- Configured pipeline with jarvis.hostfile: `/mnt/common/jcernudagarcia/demo/phase5/jarvis.hostfile`
- Hostfile successfully applied to pipeline

### 3. Environment Building
- Built jarvis environment for phase5_pipeline
- Environment build status: Completed successfully

### 4. Gray Scott Application Integration
