# Phase 5
VERY IMPORTANT: For this phase all interactions with jarvis should go through the jarvis MCP server. Do not attempt to write to jarvis file directly or use jarvis through the bash.
VERY IMPORTANT: Jarvis as a system has been configured, so the resource graph is set, and the nodes on the hostfile have been allocated. There is the need to create and configure the pipeline by building (env\_build) its enviornment and assigning the hostfile to it, DO NOT TOUCH THE RESOURCE GRAPH.
VERY IMPORTANT: You must run the pipeline
